	"content": "Building REST API (CRUD) with API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB using Python Overview In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic RESTful API on the AWS platform, performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with a DynamoDB database and using AWS Lambda to handle backend processing. By integrating API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB, we will build a complete API service without the need for traditional server setup and management, which reduces costs and simplifies deployment.\nMain Steps: Create a DynamoDB Table to store data. Build Lambda Functions to handle HTTP requests from API Gateway. Set up API Gateway to provide a RESTful endpoint for accessing Lambda functions. Connect and Test the API with CRUD operations on the data. The goal of this lab is to give you a clear understanding of the process of building a complete API using AWS serverless services, enhancing your skills in deploying services and working with NoSQL databases like DynamoDB in real applications. This is the lab architecture Main Content Introduction Create a DynamoDB Table Build Lambda Function Set up API Gateway Connect and Test the API Clean up Resources "

	"content": "In API Gateway, a resource represents a specific \u0026ldquo;resource\u0026rdquo; in your API and corresponds to a path in the API\u0026rsquo;s URL. These resources are often organized in a tree-like structure and allow you to define different parts of the API as well as assign specific functionality or logic to each part. Now we will proceed to create 3 resources: status: contains a GET method to check the status. user: contains GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods for CRUD operations on users. users: contains a GET method to retrieve the list of users. In this lab, we will enable CORS for the resources.\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a web security mechanism that allows you to control how resources from one web page can be accessed by another web page from a different origin (different domain, protocol, or port). By enabling CORS for a resource in API Gateway, you allow applications from different origins to send requests to your API.\nCreate resources: Select Create resource. In Create resource: Resource name: status. Enable CORS. Click Create resource. Successfully created the resource. Similarly, create additional resources: user and users. "

	"content": "Content:\nAmazon DynamoDB Amazon API Gateway AWS Lambda Benefits of Using API Gateway and Lambda to Build a REST API Content Amazon DynamoDB DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is a high-performance, flexible database designed to handle large volumes of data at high speed. DynamoDB supports a table-based data model and does not require rigid data structure as in relational databases, making it easy to store different types of data.\nAmazon API Gateway Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that enables developers to easily create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the \u0026ldquo;front door\u0026rdquo; for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. With API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs to enable real-time, two-way communication applications. API Gateway supports workloads in containers and serverless as well as web applications.\nAPI Gateway handles all tasks related to accepting and processing hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. There are no minimum fees or upfront commitments. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out, with API Gateway’s tiered pricing model allowing you to reduce costs as API usage scales.\nAWS Lambda AWS Lambda is a compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources, making it a fast way to turn an idea into a modern, serverless production application.\nBenefits of Using API Gateway and Lambda to Build a REST API No infrastructure management: No need to worry about maintaining and scaling servers. Automatic scaling: AWS automatically scales infrastructure based on traffic demand. Cost-effective: Only pay for Lambda executions and API Gateway request traffic. Easy integration: Integrates with other AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, RDS, etc.) to build a complete system with ease. Content Guiding you through:\nCreating a DynamoDB table to store data for your API. Creating Lambda functions to handle CRUD requests from API Gateway. Creating RESTful API endpoints and integrating with Lambda functions. Deploying and testing the API with each CRUD operation (using Postman). Cleaning up resources. "

In the Code section, we will add code in Code Source. This is the Python CRUD code that I have prepared. Select Deploy to deploy the code. Code Explanation:\nlambda_handler(event, context)\nThis is the main function for AWS Lambda, which receives events (requests) from API Gateway and routes them to the corresponding handler functions. http_method and path are extracted from the event to determine the HTTP request type and path. Based on http_method and path , the function calls helper functions like get_user, get_users, save_user, modify_user, or delete_user to handle each request. get_user(user_id)\nQueries the user_info table in DynamoDB to retrieve user information with the given userid. Uses get_item to retrieve an item from DynamoDB based on the primary key userid. Returns a JSON response with the user’s information if successful or an error message if an issue occurs. get_users()\nPerforms a scan of the entire DynamoDB table to retrieve information for all users. This function calls scan_dynamo_records to retrieve all records from the DynamoDB table, including cases where data exceeds the return capacity of a single scan. scan_dynamo_records(scan_params, item_array) This recursive function supports get_users() to scan the entire DynamoDB table when there are too many records. It uses scan to retrieve data from DynamoDB and checks for LastEvaluatedKey, indicating additional data that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been retrieved. If LastEvaluatedKey exists, the function continues scanning until all records are retrieved. save_user(request_body)\nSaves new user information into the DynamoDB table. Uses put_item to add a new item to the DynamoDB table. If successful, it returns a confirmation response and the information of the newly saved user. modify_user(user_id, update_key, update_value)\nUpdates user information based on userid, with update_key as the field to be updated and update_value as the new value. Uses update_item with UpdateExpression to specify the field and value to update. Returns a confirmation response if successful, or an error message if an issue occurs. delete_user(user_id)\nDeletes a user from the DynamoDB table based on userid. Uses delete_item to remove the item from the DynamoDB table and returns the deleted values for confirmation. If successful, it returns a confirmation response and the information of the deleted user. DecimalEncoder\nThis is a custom JSON encoder class to convert Decimal objects into int or float before including them in the JSON response. DynamoDB returns numerical values as Decimal, so this class ensures that numerical values are converted into a format that JSON can interpret. build_response(status_code, body)\nCreates a JSON response to send back to the user. status_code is the HTTP status code (200, 400, 404, etc.). body is the content of the response, encoded into JSON using the DecimalEncoder class to handle Decimal values. Together, these functions form a user management API, enabling CRUD operations on user data stored in DynamoDB. "
